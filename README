User-Config version 0.00_01
===========================

Within larger (multiuser-)applications certain configuration-items should be
configurable on an user-level. User::Config aims to provide an easy to use
interface for these.
More accurate, this module should fullfil the following tasks:
* Module-options 
	Get, set and preset default values for various configuration
	items
* Reuse configuration-items at multiple places
* Interface database-backend to save the decisions made transparently
	eg. SQL-Database, LDAP or just an in-memory database
* Interface-backend to generate dialogs
	eg. by generating a HTML-Form

Please See User::Config::Manual for a more detailed explanation of how
this should work.
